# Welcome To Linux

## Welcome to linux

Welcome to linux! If you're reading this you're likely  
new to linux entirely!

In the following sections, we'll go over a few differences  
between OS's you may be familer with, Such as _Microsoft Windows_  
or Apple's _macOS_.


# Differences in Linux

## Coming from _Microsoft Windows_

If you're familer with Windows, then many things in linux will  
feel very odd! Windows and linux share nearly no common  
ancestry, and everything under the hood is built very different.

One of the biggest differences will be the **Package Manager**.  
Nearly every linux **distro** will ship with a package manager,  
a tool for installing software via package **repositories**,  
installing software from a .exe or .msi dosent happen in linux!  
If you want some software, try this:

```shell
apt install <name of package>
```
