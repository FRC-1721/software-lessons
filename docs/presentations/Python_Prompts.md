# 0.1 Hello World!

Every programmer starts somewhere! And for nearly all of us, it was a hello world program.

To start, simply make a new file `helloworld.py` (or any name `.py`) and type:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

And tada! If your promt looks like:

```sh
Hello World!
```

Then thats it!
