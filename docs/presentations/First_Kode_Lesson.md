# Intro

## Welcome

This is where the fun starts...
we get to download things!


# Download and accounts

## Online Accounts

Make sure you have an account with:

 - **GitHub**
   - Version Control
 - **Discord** 
   - Recommended for team communication (optional, but strongly recommended)
 - **FIRST** 
   - Be a member of the team (for the team, not just code)


## Software Downloading (I know, you can't wait to start)

 - **Visual Studio Code** - Recommended IDE (Lessons Will be done with VSCode)
   - Python
   - Java
   - WPIlib 
 - **Languages (Python, Java)**
   - Download these into your brain to learn to code (maybe put it on your PC too?)
 - **GitHub Desktop** 
   - Version Control (for updating and pushing code)
 - **National Instruments Game Tools** 
   - Interact with the robot
 - **Robotpy** 
   - Robot now with snakes (they know python)


# Anatomy of a code

## What is a code?

Can you eat it? maybe...


## Variables

```python
x = 15  # x is an int
myVar = "Doot!"  # myVar is a string
```

- Variables:
   - int
   - string
   - float
   - list
   - tupes (not used often)


# Basic Functions

## Basic Functions

*Computer go **brrrrrrr***

```python
print()
```

Math +\-*%/=><


# Examples

## Example 1

### Take what you've learned and show off!

Try to make a program that takes in a **variable** and raises  
it to the power of **3**

## Functions

*Repeat the task again*

If() & else() - Should I do dat?  
operators ><&|!= - Should I *really* do dat?

def() - Define your own!

## Loops

*Repeat the task ***again!!!****

For() - Do it 10 times!
While() - Do it ***FOREVER***
Break() - ok stop now

## Example 2

**Modify your code to create the following:**
create a **function** that takes in two numbers. 
The first number should be raised to the power of the
second number, then the output should br **returned**

## Classes

*Your in one right now*

Class() - I already made the learning joke
We'll get more into these next time... 

## Google

Your **#1** tool (also me)

## Example 3

**A final exam!! Fail and you'll be fed to the robot!!**
Create a **class** to act as a calculator of sorts, but for **arrays**
Each class should have 3 **functions**:
    -One for adding the values of an array (eg. [1,2,3] -> 6)
    -One for multiplying the values of an array (eg. [4,2,3] -> 24)
    -One for finding the lowest **and** highest value in the array (eg. [1,4,7] -> 1 and 7)

## End of lesson 1

Thank you for playing!
